Job Scheduling using Weighted Interval Scheduling with Dynamic Programming

**Dataset:** This project utilizes two datasets from the Google Job Scheduling Dataset or the Kaggle Job Shop Scheduling Dataset, which contain real-world data about job start times, finish times, and profit or priority values.

This project uses two real-world datasets  (e.g., the Google Job Scheduling Dataset and the Kaggle Job Shop Scheduling Dataset) both containing information on job start times, finish times, and associated profits or priority values.

**Concept:** The project applies the Weighted Interval Scheduling Algorithm using Dynamic Programming (DP) to determine the optimal set of non-overlapping jobs that maximizes the total profit. Each job has a start time, finish time, and an associated profit, and the algorithm efficiently selects the combination of jobs that yields the highest total value without time conflicts.

**Goal:** The objective is to optimize job assignments by balancing time constraints and profit values, ensuring that the system schedules jobs in a way that achieves maximum overall benefit while maintaining efficiency in resource utilization.

**Deliverable:** A concise report comparing the performance and outcomes of the Weighted Interval Scheduling with DP algorithm across the two datasets.
